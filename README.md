# ForamReasearch
Foraminifera research for Professor Schwing
This research is for a mining company within the Gulf of Mexico. The purpose of the research is to establish a baseline to determine the disturbance caused by mining of metal nodes in the area. The dataset will be run through NMDS. PCA and CanoniCo are both also possible future ordination functions, but only NMDS has been successfully implemented at the moment.
